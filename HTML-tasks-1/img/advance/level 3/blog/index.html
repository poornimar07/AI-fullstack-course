        <h1>My First blog post</h1>
        <p> Welcome to my blog! Today, I want to share why learning coding step by step feels exciting. 
      Coding is not just about writing programs - it’s about solving problems, creating new things, 
      and making ideas come alive. Even small projects like a blog page or a to-do list can boost 
      your confidence. The key is practice and patience!
